<h3>About this app</h3>

<p>This application is a part of my portfolio showcase demonstrating modern backend development with containerization.</p>

<p>It illustrates how backend and database containers can work seamlessly together using Entity Framework (EF) Core, providing efficient data management and interaction.</p>

<p>The app highlights practical use of EF for data access in a containerized environment, showcasing my skills in backend architecture, database integration, and DevOps practices.</p>
